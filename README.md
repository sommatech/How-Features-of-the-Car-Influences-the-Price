# How-Features-of-the-Car-Influences-the-Price

**Summary of Analysis Steps and Findings:**

**Data Exploration and Visualization:**
The dataset was analyzed to understand the relationship between car features (like engine, body style, stroke, etc.) and prices (expensive or cheap). Visualizations such as count plots, box plots, scattered plots, and regression plots were used to investigate patterns in car features versus price.

**Key Factor Identification:**
The most significant finding was that car features affect the prices of the car. This factor is that car prices depend on the features.

**Automotive Pricing Strategy Analysis:**** 
Car price solely depends on the features and the engine is expensive if it is large and in good condition. Having multiple car features (such as stroke, driver-wheel, and body-style) correlated with price.

**Limitations and Insights:**
The dataset was mainly made up of binary categorical variables, which restricted the statistical methods that could be applied. Due to the categorical nature of the variables, only weak correlations were found, and the analysis concentrated on identifying correlations rather than determining cause-and-effect relationships.
